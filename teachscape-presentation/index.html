          <h1>Design Guidelines</h1>
    
        <h3>Rams&#8217;s Ten Principles of &#8220;Good Design&#8221;</h3>
        <br><ol>
          <li><strong>Good Design Is Innovative </strong>—  The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted.  Technological development is always offering new opportunities for  innovative design. But innovative design always develops in tandem with  innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Good Design Makes a Product Useful</strong> —A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria,  not only functional but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design  emphasizes the usefulness of a product while disregarding anything that  could possibly detract from it.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Good Design Is Aesthetic</strong> —The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness  because products are used every day and have an effect on people and  their well-being. Only well-executed objects can be beautiful.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Good Design Makes A Product Understandable</strong> —It clarifies the product's structure. Better still, it can make the  product clearly express its function by making use of the user's  intuition. At best, it is self-explanatory.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Good Design Is Unobtrusive</strong> — Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither  decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be  both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user's  self-expression.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Good Design Is Honest</strong> — It  does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it  really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises  that cannot be kept</li><br>
          <li><strong>Good Design Is Long-lasting</strong> — It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated.  Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years – even in today's  throwaway society.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Good Design Is Thorough Down to the Last Detail</strong> —Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the consumer.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Good Design Is Environmentally Friendly</strong> — Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the  environment. It conserves resources and minimises physical and visual  pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Good Design Is as Little Design as Possible</strong> —Less, but better – because it concentrates on the essential aspects,  and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity,  back to simplicity.</li><br>
        </ol>

           <h3>10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design</h3>
        <br><ol>
          <li><strong>Visibility of system status</strong> — The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Match between system and the real world</strong> — The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.</li><br>
          <li><strong>User control and freedom</strong> — Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Consistency and standards</strong> — Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Error prevention</strong> — Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Recognition rather than recall</strong> — Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.
          (Read full article on <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/recognition-and-recall/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">recognition vs. recall in UX.</a>)</li><br>
          <li><strong>Flexibility and efficiency of use</strong> — Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Aesthetic and minimalist design</strong> — Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</strong> — Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Help and documentation</strong> — Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.</li><br>
